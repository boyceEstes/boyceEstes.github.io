# Block Habit Privacy Policy

Block Habit collects *no* personal data at all from users. It operates without collecting personal information like name, email, or location.

We use an analytics service called TelemetryDeck to track how the app is used (such as which features are most popular) to help us improve the app. This data is completely anonymous and cannot be linked back to any individual user.

When your app is deleted from your phone, any habit data that was entered will be universally gone, and impossible to retrieve.

There is no personal information required for this app to work (name, email, location, etc.)

There is no marketing or advertisements or sharing with third parties.

If there any changes to this policy, users will be notified.

Contact me at estes.boyce@gmail.com if there are any questions or concerns about privacy or data collection.
